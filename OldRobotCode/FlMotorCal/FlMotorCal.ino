Robot Motors Direction Tests

 This test makes sure we get all four of the motor dirction pins correct.

 The program should moves the right wheel forward, right reverse, left forward and left reverse.

 Keep changing these numbers or jumper wires until you get it right directions for each wheel

 Use the serial monitor to verify which one should be working

 Note, On the Arduino Nano, ONLY pins 3,5,6,9,10 and 11 have PWM output.  You must use these to drive the motors.

 See https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardNano

 

 The convention is to use the first four pins (3,5,6,9) for the motor controls

 If you use a ribbon connector the order will be 5,3,6 and 9
